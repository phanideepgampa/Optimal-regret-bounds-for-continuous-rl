# Optimal-regret-bounds-for-continuous-rl
This is a code used for simulations of my paper titled ***A tractable algorithm for Finite Horizon Continuous Reinforcement Learning***. The code is written in c++ with external dependency on ***boost serialize*** library.

The pre-print version of the paper can be found [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11245)
